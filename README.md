Liking LaTeX is kind of the only reason I have made this repository. The other reason is that this provides a nice way to record how my LaTeX documents have changed. <br>
Chronologically, the documents are:

+ [Model Zoo:](./Model%20Zoo.pdf) The first LaTeX document that I edited, although I did not have to change the template, rather just update the <i>content</i> of the document. The document was the end-term report of the summer project [Model Zoo](https://github.com/pclubiitk/model-zoo) offered by the [Programming Club, IIT-K](https://github.com/pclubiitk/). All thanks to them for providing the template and getting me initiated.
+ [ESO207 Mid-Sem:](./ESO207%20MS.pdf) The first LaTeX document that I wrote from scratch (almost) where I typeset the questions of my mid-semester exam in the course [ESO207](https://github.com/cliche-niche/ESO207) in my 3<sup>rd</sup> semester.
+ [CS201 Mid-Sem:](./CS201%20MS.pdf) First encounter with writing non-trivial mathematics in LaTeX. Course repository [here](https://github.com/cliche-niche/CS20X/tree/main/CS201).
+ [ESO207 Programming Assignment 2:](./ESO207%20PA2.pdf) First experience with packages for algorithms (`algorithm2e` and `algorithmic`)!
+ [CS201 Assignment:](./CS201%A1.pdf) First experience with using `tikZ` package for drawing graphs in LaTeX.
+ [CS201 End-Sem:](./CS201%20ES.pdf) First experience with using `hyperref` package in LaTeX.
+ [CS220 Assignment 2:](./CS220%20A2.pdf) Second encounter with `tikZ` (`CircuitikZ`) package, but this time for drawing electrical circuits!
+ [CS220 Assignment 3:](./CS220%20A3.pdf) Third encounter with `tikZ` package, but this time for drawing FSMs. Also, first encounter with the `karnaugh-map` package for drawing nice colourful Karnaugh Maps.
+ [CS203 Assignment 2:](./CS203%20A2.pdf) Using colored texts and boxes (`[dvipsnames]xcolor`). 
+ [CS220 Assignment 4:](./CS220%20A4.pdf) Batman, because why not. No other reason
+ [CS300 Assignment 3:](./CS300%20A3.pdf) First document using two columns! (Using `multicol`)
